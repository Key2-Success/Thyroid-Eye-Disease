# Thyroid Eye Disease
As a culminating group project for our Statistics major, we were paired with clients (doctors from Jules Stein Eye Associate) to analyze their data and suggest statistical findings that could help them with their current as well as future research work.

## Content
I have included our final report, powerpoint presentation, and R code. Since this was a group project, all members assembled various parts to the project, yet we were all familiar with each others' sections. 

## Notes
This was the first time any of us were working in such a large team. With a total of 6 members, all of whom were close friends to begin with, it was easy and quite fun to delegate sections based on each others' strengths and weaknesses. We had been working in many group projects prior to this one, so it was with much ease that we transitioned into a larger one. Moreover, we were given small data, a disparity with the kind of data we usually work with in class. We were taught that real life data need not always be large, so working with such a small data set (less than 100 observations), we had to be very mindful of the assumptions we were making when we built models.
